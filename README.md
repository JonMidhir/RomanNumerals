Roman Numerals Converter!
=========================

I was challenged to do this in Ruby as a programming exercise recently. Since I ended up using recursion for that I figured I'd give it a go in Haskell.

```haskell
  ghci> :l toRoman
  
  ghci> toRoman 10
  "X"
  
  ghci> toRoman 2014
  "MMXIV"
  
  ghci> toRoman 1999
  "MCMXCIX"
```
